TODO: Fix separated Season/Episode like "The Show S02 E05.mkv" 
TODO: GUI configuration tool
TODO: Fix multi-episode rename for nondefault format strings
--------------------------
Version 2.2.0 - 11/15/2012
--------------------------
Refactored code and improved comments & readability

Fixed rename on files like "The Show - S02E05.mkv"

Fixed bug where sourcedir is deleted if it is empty

New titlecaser!! Covers more cases but should run as fast

Fixed permissions error while copying between filesystems - Thanks to Saad Javed

Added popup notifications via pynotify library - Thanks to Saad Javed

Version 2.1.0 - 5/9/2012
------------------------
Adds %T (TITLE), %sm (Mar), %SM (MAR), and %FM (MARCH) format strings

Fixed really stupid overwrite 'bug'

Added stay_open and no_rename fields in addition to debug. Stay_open prompts before exit, and no_rename makes the script print output without sorting files (no file operations at all -- mainly for test)

Added an exception where the file is thought to be a non-dated show with a year, but has no season. Will now detect these files as movies.

Detects irregularly spaced quality from title in movies (e.g. Movie.Title.2007.LIMITED.1080p now works where before only Movie.Title.2007.1080p did)

Allows rename of movies without quality or year attributes, but WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FORMAT THE FILENAME, ONLY MOVES THE FILE TO MOVIE DIRECTORY. (e.g. "ctf.jack.and.jill.xvid.avi" -> dest\Ctf Jack and Jill.avi)

Added mp4 as default extension since the Scene adopted x264 for sd rips.

Improved bracket sanitization to check for mismatched right bracket.

Improve output by dynamically altering the size of the path displayed to fit on a line

Added outputfull field to prevent dynamic output size.

Removed redundant calls to index_fs()
